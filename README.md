# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Week 5 of Technigo bootcamp and we were assigned to do a mystery randomizer for the game leader of a Cluedo game. The site should consits of three deck of cards which when you clicked them randomly gave you a murderer, a weapon and a room where the murder took place. We should also have a button that summon up the mystery in text when clicked. 

## The problem

For this projcet we used JavaScript functions and created arrays to store the objects that was connceted to the different suspects and weapons.
